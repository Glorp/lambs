## How to?

You should have a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) and an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Racket should be on `PATH` so that it can be started with `racket`. If the Emacs can display PNGs then that's a thing it can do. Otherwise it can't. Nusuth.

Set environment variable `HOME` to this repo-dir, cross your fingers, run Emacs, cross your toes.

## Can maybe just view the stuff from the Code Mesh talk without doing the Racket bits?

Yes. If you checkout this branch. Run Emacs and open the [mesh.txt](lambs/mesh.txt) file, you mostly get the stuff from the talk. You still need to set HOME to the repo-dir in order to show the pictures (do `C-x C-e` on the insert-pic-expressions to insert pics), but you won't need any Racket bits for it.
